Sort Project:
Part 1:  (BASIC)
  1. Analyze the two constructors - try to figure out how they work.
  2. Compile and run the program (SortProjectDriver.java and SortProject.java) and confirm
  the behavior of the constructors.
  Part 2: (BASIC)
  1. Read the description of findSmallestIndex and complete the method.
  2. Uncomment the lines in SortProjectDriver to test.
  Part 3: (INTERMEDIATE)
  1. Complete the sort method - read comments for description
  2. Uncomment the lines in sortProjectDriver to test.
Search Project:
  1. Complete the linear search (BASIC)
  2. Complete the binary search (Intermediate)
  3. Complete the recursive version of binary search (Advanced)

It was changed based on the demon This is  sets up the search through the arrayList to find the smallest index starting at 0
//which is what this i counter is
