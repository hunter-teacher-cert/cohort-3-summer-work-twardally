#### by Team High 5!
Roster: Sarah McCoy, Alicia White, Tanya Wardally, Ed Hawkins


### Technique: Tiered Products

#### Well-suited to...
* coding projects
* "unplugged" activities
* most student deliverables

#### Example
* Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Challenge level tasks/products/deliverables


### Technique: Comments/Directions

#### Well-suited to...
* larger tiered projects
* gets students to starting point
* helps students connect psuedocode to actual syntax

#### Example
* students are working on ieration - loops & condtionals
* program tracing on paper
* code snippet to illustrate
* etc

#### Technique: Starter Code

#### Well-suited to...
* coding assignments with time constraints (i.e. class period, etc.)
* focus on the specific learning target of the activity
  

#### Example
* Most (all?) of the coding projects for the Hunter College program
  

#### Technique: Live Coding

#### Well-suited to...
* supports all level coders at the same time
* multi-player
* promote student interaction
* remote learning

#### Example
* Any new concept taught
* code snippet to illustrate
* 
  
### Technique: Pre-recorded "Live Coding"

#### Well-suited to...
* Asynchronous/remote activities
* Differentiating instruction
* Helping students with attendence challenges
* Teaching best practices: keyboard shortcuts, naming conventions, save often, etc.

#### Example
* Record screen while talking through a coding activity
* Record student demos and post (with permission)
