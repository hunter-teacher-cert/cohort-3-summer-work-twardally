Teacher: What does the word Linear mean to you?
How can we apply that definition to searching through an array?
Goal 1 - Compare binary vs linear search?  *Assuming we have reviewed binary search.
Assignment 1 - Diagram the procedure and outline the steps involved in a linear search

What variables do you have to initialize as parameters?
What does this program return if the value is not found? If found?
Why do we initialize foundIndex to -1? 
What do we need to type inside of a class when we are creating a class?
