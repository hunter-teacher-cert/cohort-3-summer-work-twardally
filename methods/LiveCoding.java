    // VERSION 2 :: replace the hard coded five with the numberOfTimes variable.

    //MUST-ANSWER-Q :: do you think version 1 and 2 will have the same result?

    //STUDENT-PROMPT :: How will the output change if we update numberOfTimes to 7?
    //BEEG REVEAL :: the condition is a for loop can use a variable that can update throughout the program.

    // Version 3 :: Add a scanner in to prompt the user for a number
    // PROVIDE :: Scanner input code
    System.out.println("How many times do you want to print!");

    //STUDENT-PROMPT :: While running, ask the students what number will numberOfTimes hold?

    //DELIBERATE-ERROR :: Students usually choose increasingly big numbers, we could but a number bigger than max int number, larger than 2,147,483,647, try 3 billion
