CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- Allows peers to teach each other through sharing their traces (peer sharing)
- Show you how the computer runs the code
- Helps de-mystify the code for some students

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- Stronger students feel like they're in the hot seat (forced TA's in a way)
- Could be counter-productive in some circumstances
- time consuming & hard to model because there isn't one way to do it

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
- helps to understand loops, iteration & recursion
- helps to distinguish between loops, recursion, etc.
- comparing efficiency if different approaches to problems
- following the values of variables to determine the output of the program

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
- testing large values
- multi-step recursion as an intial demo 


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer 
  -multiplayer digital tools
  -multi colors
 * etc
